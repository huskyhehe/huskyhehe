### Hi there 👋

<br>

🎓 I'm huskyhehe, a graduate student majoring in Information Systems (Computer Software Engineering track).

🗃 Currently I'm working on a Co-op as a **Cloud Software Engineer** at **New York Life** from January to May 2023. 
<!-- My main work includes:
  - Boost sales agents efficiency by implementing the Retirement Assessment Module of an insurance planning and recommendation tool which ranks 6th most frequently used application using **JavaScript** (Node.js, React, Redux) at Digital Research & Development Lab.
  - Consume **Java Spring** & **PostgreSQL** **RESTful** services using Axios. 
  - Monitor performance by sending logs to **AWS CloudWatch**. -->

🔭 I enjoy learning new things and pushing my boundaries of knowledge! I have been practicing various tech stacks through **40+ repos** on GitHub (Not only a LeetCoder 😝).
<!-- You can find my repos using tags such as:
